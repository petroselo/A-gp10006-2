Create program to print out cards and "spaces". Which are a4 or a3 papers with 
corner markers

Explore camera calibration and make a program to calibrate a camera.

Make a general loop to process options and spaces.

Explore threading for UI and image processing.

Explore Time blurring at the marker detection step to make things more resiliant.
Explore playing with camera parameters to maek things more resiliant as well. Maybe at camera start up, or put down a pc configure marker which brings up a UI to configure.

Make a simple 3A1 demo with coloured circles in a space.

Make a simple logic gate demo which also lets you combine cards into super cards.

Make a simple controller to be able to adjust parameters. A slider or a rotating arrow.



Less feasible. Put 4A2 code into this.
